# Predicting the Sales Price of Bulldozers using Machine Learning

### 1. Problem Statement

> How well can we predict the future sale price of a bulldozer given its characteristics and previous examples of how much similar bulldozers have been sold for?

### 2. Data
> Data is from Kaggle Blue book for Bulldozers competition : https://www.kaggle.com/c/bluebook-for-bulldozers/data

+ For this competition, you are predicting the sale price of bulldozers sold at auctions.
  The data for this competition is split into three parts:
  
  Train.csv is the training set, which contains data through the end of 2011.
  
  Valid.csv is the validation set, which contains data from January 1, 2012 - April 30,
  2012 You make predictions on this set throughout the majority of the competition. Your   
  score on this set is used to create the public leaderboard.

  Test.csv is the test set, which won't be released until the last week of the     
  competition. It contains data from May 1, 2012 - November 2012. Your score on the test   
  set determines your final rank for the competition.

### 3. Evaluation
The evaluation metric for this competetion is the RMSLE (Root Mean Squared Log Error) between the actual data and the predicted auction prices as suggested by the competition.

For more on the evaluation of this project check:

**Note:**  The goal for the regression evaluation metrics is to minimise the error.

### Our Goal:
The goal of this project is to reduce build a machine learning model to minimise RMSLE.

### 4. Features
